              My first ever kitty I adopted since 2016. He was 6 months old when
              I first met him at a local shelter. Since then he has been very
              needy and always want snuggle times but very shy when it comes to
              strangers.

              Pika&apos;s little brother. Came home a few months after Pika.
              He&apos;s a lot more independent compared to his brother but
              can&apos;t resist a good belly rub. He&apos;s so loveable that
              Pika started grooming him after just one day.
