        üëãüèº Hey there! my name is Kiet Nghiem but I go by Mark most of the time. I
        am a passionate and hungry-for-knowledge Software Engineer dedicated to
        continuously improve myself with self-education and hands-on experiences
        by building scalable applications and intuitive user and developer
        experiences while adhering to best practices and staying informed with
        the latest technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        üõ†Ô∏è With expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and
        Kubernetes, I specialize in creating efficient, maintainable, and secure
        software solutions.

      <p className="mb-2">
        ‚ú® I love seeing people around me happy and accomplish great things.
        Therefore I enjoy helping my teammates both technical and non-technical
        issues within my ability whenever I can.

        engineers, and constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies. When

            My first ever kitty I adopted since 2016. He was 6 months old when I
            first met him at a local shelter. Since then he has been very needy
            and always want snuggle times but very shy when it comes to
            strangers

            Pika&apos;s little brother. Came home a few months after Pika.
            He&apos;s a lot more independent compared to his brother but
            can&apos;t resist a good belly rub. He&apos;s so loveable that Pika
            started grooming him after just one day.
